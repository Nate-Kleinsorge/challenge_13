## Description: 
I wanted to make this to show myself that i could build a website on my own. 
I built this to further invest myself in my new skills, and help other people keep track of their products.
This application allows the user to keep track of prices and inventory of products they sell.
I learned that the backend is as, if not more important as the front end for the user.
